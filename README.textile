h1. TextMetal

TextMetal is a powerful meta-programming framework written in C#. It uses XML as the extensible template language and hosts the dynamic language run-time (DLR) and IronRuby to provide rich expression/logic support.

Meta-programming is all about making software simpler and reusable through the use of programming language independent skills and computer programs that write new computer programs.

TextMetal is a framework for accelerating the delivery, increasing the quality, and reducing the time to market of small to enterprise scale software systems.
